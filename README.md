# Time-Series-Analysis-Water-Usage
Hello! 

This is Ziyan Lin, a graduate student from Johns Hopkins University, majoring in applied math and statistics.


In this repository, there is an individual project developed by time series analysis. The project is completed when I was in University of Iowa for undergraduate study.


The objective of this project is to find the relationship between time and monthly water usage. The dataset records monthly water usage in London from January 1966 to December 1988, and it is obtained from https://datamarket.com/data/set/22qu/monthly-water-usage-mlday-london-ontario-1966-1988#!ds=22qu&display=line. 

Based on ACF plots, two different ARIMA models are applied into dataset, and then outlier checking and model diagnosis are implemented to compare these two models. Although these models cannot provide predictions, they already offer sufficient messages. 

This repository contains all code for [time series analysis](), one final [presentation slide](https://github.com/lzykaren/Time-Series-Analysis-Water-Usage/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Presentation%20%20Slide.pdf), and one [final report](https://github.com/lzykaren/Time-Series-Analysis-Water-Usage/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Final%20Report.pdf). If you have any question or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much.
